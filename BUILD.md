For the building purpose of a **Package** or **Docker Image** it is recommended to first clone the repo:
```
git clone <repo_url>
```

# Docker Image Build
To build the Robot docker image you can simply run the *build_container.sh* also found on the root folder of this repo:
```bash
./build_container.sh
```
